# Bhuvan Project

This is a Python-based application that appears to detect or process financial fraud based on CSV datasets. The main files include scripts, datasets, and configuration files required to run and generate results.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project folder.
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Main Application

The entry point appears to be `app.py`:

```bash
python app.py
```

This script may load the transaction logs and perform fraud detection or analysis.

### 2. Generate Data (Optional)

To generate or manipulate datasets:

```bash
python generate.py
```

This may simulate or pre-process data for the application.

## Files Description

* `app.py`: Main script to run the fraud detection or analytics logic.
* `generate.py`: Likely used to generate synthetic data or handle dataset pre-processing.
* `large_transaction_log.csv`: Raw transaction data.
* `sample_fraud_dataset.csv`: Pre-labeled fraud dataset.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Notes

* Ensure both CSV files are in the root project directory for the scripts to locate them correctly.
* You may need to adjust file paths inside the scripts depending on your environment.
